# Bike Sharing analysis for Des Moines

## Overview of the Statistical analysis
In an effort to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, we’ve compiled and analyzed usage data that highlights break outs by Time, Gender, and User type. 	

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
While May has the most plays launched by month, it also has the highest success rate at 66.87%. Reviewing the months with the lowest number of launch dates, January, March, September, and December, they also show the lowest success rates.

The most successful campaigns had goals >$5000 or between $35k and $45k. The worst performing campaigns occurred when goals exceeded $45k.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset only presents beginning and ending campaign dates. It’d be great to show the pledging occur over time to better understand where/when campaigns lose their momentum.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Similar to measuring Plays, it'd be great to see a breakdown by Parent categories. Comparing the various categories we can potentially see how the campaigns pan out in different spaces.
