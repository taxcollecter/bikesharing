# Bike Sharing analysis for Des Moines

## Overview of the Statistical analysis
In an effort to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, weâ€™ve compiled and analyzed usage data that highlights break outs by Time, Gender, and User type. 	

## Results
- August Peak Hours
This graph highlights peak Bike usage. Notice the steady climb of usage beginning at 10 and subsiding at the 18th hour of the day.

- Trips by Weekday/Gender/User Type
This view layers on User Type (Customer/Subscriber). It reaffirms the heavier usage by the Male population. Note, the non-subscribers show consistency between genders to usage.

## Summary
In summary, we believe there is a prime opportunity to introduce the Bike sharing program in Des Moines! Per the data, we have a supportive Male population. Clearly there are opportunities to win with the Female population as well. We will need to ensure bikes are ready for both Rush hours 8am/5pm, where the bikes are heavily leveraged. We will also want to determine how we can market Lunch and Weekend usage to get these numbers up. I've added links to other opportunities to dig into below. Finally, the view have been compiled in a store to aid in consumption. 

- Consolidated Story for consumption

- Additional Opportunity #1
Removing the break out by Gender, we see that the Majority of our trips persist for less than 20 minutes. We should market our trips for payments of 5 minute intervals. This will give the customer more control over their charges AND enable the bikes to be reset and reused more frequently.

- Additional Opportunity #2
Of the 2.3M rides, 1.9M consisted of members subscribed. Clearly we need to address how we can increase the usage of the bikes by those who are not subscribed.
