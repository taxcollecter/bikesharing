# Bike Sharing analysis for Des Moines

## Overview of the Statistical analysis
In an effort to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, we’ve compiled and analyzed usage data that highlights break outs by Time, Gender, and User type. 	

## Results

The most successful campaigns had goals >$5000 or between $35k and $45k. The worst performing campaigns occurred when goals exceeded $45k.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset only presents beginning and ending campaign dates. It’d be great to show the pledging occur over time to better understand where/when campaigns lose their momentum.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Similar to measuring Plays, it'd be great to see a breakdown by Parent categories. Comparing the various categories we can potentially see how the campaigns pan out in different spaces.
